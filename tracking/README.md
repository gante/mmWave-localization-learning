# Tracking - Estimates from Sequences of Beamformed Fingerprints [EXPERIMENTAL]

This folder contains the files related to tracking (estimates from sequences of beamformed fingerprints). To train the system, follow the steps below

## Running Sequence

- [If the preprocessing wasn't run] Download the 'final_table' file into the '~\mmWave-localization-learning\data_preprocessing\data_processed' folder; 
- Edit 'simulation_parameters.py' to the desired settings;
- Run the .py files whose names start with integers (1, 2, 3) sequentially.
