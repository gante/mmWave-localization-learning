# GENERAL
1 - Change the preprocessing to python (there is no need for C++, it only
    overcomplicates stuff)
2 - Clean the code (remove non-english comments, make sure everything has
    <80 chars per line, ...)
3 - Add comments
4 - Swap the "exec" in python to proper loading mechanisms


#PERFORMANCE
1 - ml_training/2-DNN_classifier_train.py: Add feature noise in GPU, not in CPU
    (should speed up!)
